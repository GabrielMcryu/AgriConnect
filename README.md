## Features

Agri Connect is a revolutionary software solution that transforms the agricultural industry. It comprises two main components: an Admin Panel and a Web Application.

The Admin Panel, powered by .NET Remoting and WinForms, acts as the centralized control center for the application. Administrators can securely log in and access a comprehensive range of features. With complete control over the system, administrators can effectively manage and manipulate data. This includes the ability to add, delete, update, and view products for both vendors and suppliers. The Admin Panel also provides a transaction log, allowing administrators to track all transactions conducted by vendors and suppliers. Furthermore, administrators can create new administrator accounts, granting them appropriate access and privileges to manage the system effectively.

The Web Application, built using .NET Web API and Angular, offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for suppliers and vendors. Users can effortlessly register on the platform, specifying their role as either a supplier or a vendor. Once logged in, they are seamlessly directed to personalized dashboards tailored to their specific roles. Suppliers can conveniently list and sell their products, while vendors can browse and purchase items from the available listings. Additionally, users have access to their transaction history, ensuring transparency and fostering accountability.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as .NET Remoting, Microsoft SQL Server, WinForms, .NET Web API, and Angular, Agri Connect provides a seamless and efficient experience for all stakeholders involved in the agricultural value chain. Whether it's the admin effectively managing the system, creating new administrator accounts, viewing user details, suppliers listing and selling their products, or vendors making purchases, Agri Connect empowers users with the essential tools needed to thrive in the dynamic agricultural marketplace.
