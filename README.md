# AGRI CONNECT

Agri Connect is a groundbreaking software project that facilitates direct trade between farmers and our platform, eliminating intermediaries and lowering costs for farmers. By connecting farmers directly with Agri Connect, they can achieve higher profits for their products. Our platform specializes in value-added processing, transforming raw agricultural goods into refined products such as mango juice. These products are then sold to vendors, who can offer them to consumers at affordable prices. Agri Connect revolutionizes the agricultural industry by empowering farmers and creating a transparent marketplace for high-quality agricultural goods.

## Technologies Used

Agri Connect is a comprehensive software solution that revolutionizes the agricultural industry. It consists of two main components: an Admin Panel and a Web Application.

The Admin Panel, built using .NET Remoting and WinForms, serves as the control center for the application. Administrators can log in securely and access a range of features. They have complete control over the system, allowing them to manage and manipulate data. This includes adding, deleting, updating, and viewing products for both vendors and suppliers. The Admin Panel also provides a transaction log, enabling administrators to track all transactions made by vendors and suppliers.

The Web Application, developed with .NET Web API and Angular, offers a user-friendly interface for suppliers and vendors. Users can register on the platform, specifying their role as either a supplier or a vendor. Once logged in, they are directed to their respective dashboards. Suppliers can list and sell their products, while vendors can browse and purchase products from the available listings. Additionally, users can view their transaction history, providing transparency and accountability.

By utilizing technologies such as .NET Remoting, Microsoft SQL Server, WinForms, .NET Web API, and Angular, Agri Connect provides a seamless and efficient experience for all stakeholders involved in the agricultural value chain. Whether it's the admin managing the system or suppliers and vendors conducting transactions, Agri Connect empowers users with the tools they need to thrive in the agricultural marketplace.
